                This project started with the question “Will an AI help us to become a better designer?” More and more companies are using AI in thier products or to optimize workflows. As designers we are questioning ourselfs how we are effected by these develpoments. On the one side it can accelerate designprocesses and interations. A good example is the tool of airbnb, where AI is used  to transfrom wireframesketches into code. On the other side there are tools like pinterest. Which is often used as moodboard for new ideas. Pinterest is using an AI to optimize searchresults for there users based on their preferences. As a designer you might want to see the full range of posibilities and not be harmed or compromised by an computer, which prefilters the results of your search.

            <h3>Designmethods & Blindspots</h3>

            <p>
                In the designprocess we use certain methods to overcome our blindspots which we all have due to our experience, interest and culture. As frist step I tried to sort design methods from AI to no AI and from empathetic to programmatic, to find out which methods might benefit from AI. All the Methods I analysed are mostly used to help to structure designprocesses or understanding usersneeds. The best way to describe userneeds is the idea of mental models.

                    What would happen if we combine the idea of mental models with an AI? Probably it would create stereotypes depending on the data which it was trained with. Looking through the “eyes” of AI on mental models, we able to see patterns and behaviours with an objective view. If AIs are trained with user data each action should be seen as a logical decision in the process. It could predict the paths of users with different mental models.

            <h3>Mental Model Debugger</h3>

            <p>
                I wanted to make use of those stereotypes and use them in the designprocess as a tool to overcome the blindspots of designers. Every codinglanguage has a debuggingtool to find errors in the code. With the help of augmented intelligence this could also be possible for UX-Designers to check thier protoype multiple times before they start real usertest.

            <h4>Defining Users</h4>

            <p>
                For usertests we need differnt users who have different characteristcs in their use of devices and apps. To define those users in a tool, we need to find parameters which describe the users behavior and are also visible in the trainingdata of the AI. During the time of the project I collected parameters which can define users:
            </p>

            <div class="parameters">
                <div class="parameterItem">How frequent is the usage?</div>
                <div class="parameterItem">How explorative is the user?</div>
                <div class="parameterItem">Time spend in the app?</div>
                <div class="parameterItem">light or heavy user?</div>
                <div class="parameterItem">desktop or mobil?</div>
                <div class="parameterItem">How many clicks are needed?</div>
                <div class="parameterItem">Left or right handed?</div>
                <div class="parameterItem">Which OS is used?</div>
                <div class="parameterItem">cultural Background?</div>

            <h3>Sketching Layouts</h3>

            <p>
                There are two possibilities to integrate this tool in the designprocess. Either it is integrated in the prototypingtool as a plugin or it is a standalone app.
            </p>

            <div class="twoRows">
                <img src="IMG/Plugin_mockup.png" alt="plugin">
                <p>
                    As Plugin it would be more convient to use but the missing space would compromise the interface of the tool and therefore the userexperience.
                </p>

 
            </div>
            
            <div class="twoRows" style="flex-direction: row-reverse;">
                <img src="IMG/Standalone_Mockup.png">
                <p>
                    A standalone application would give more room for the interface and also the focus of the user would be more on analyzing the prototype itself without making constant changes.
